        To begin with, modern game development is heavily dependent on computer science.
        In today's world, developers use powerful engines like Unreal Engine that rely on programming languages such as C++ to design 3D worlds, graphics and movements. There
        is a general cycle that many game creators follow, whether it is a solo indie game or a 300-person studio project. This cycle includes six steps to making a video game.

        <b>Thinking of an idea:</b> This is where you brainstorm about what you want the game to be about. It could be a sports game, a first person shooter, or a story driven game.</li>
        <li>
          <b>Designing the game:</b> This step involves creating the idea of the game based on how the player will experience it. Examples include how a character moves or how maps are built.</li>
        <li>
          <b>Making the game:</b> Here the production happens. Programmers write code, artists make 3D models, and sound designers create music and effects.</li>
        <li>
          <b>Testing the game:</b> Once most of the production is complete, the game is shown to other people for feedback. This includes checking if the game is fun and easy to understand.</li>
        <li>
          <b>Finishing the game:</b> Developers often feel their game is never fully done. Deadlines and budgets push them to finalize the game.</li>
        <li>
          <b>Publishing the game:</b> This is when the game is realeased for people to play. Platforms like Steam Direct or the Epic Games Store allow developers to publish games.</li>
