        To begin with, modern game development is heavily dependent on computer science.
        In today's world, developers use powerful engines like Unreal Engine that rely on programming languages such as C++ to design 3D worlds, graphics and movements. There
        is a general cycle that many game creators follow, whether it is a solo indie game or a 300-person studio project. This cycle includes six steps to making a video game.

        <b>Thinking of an idea:</b> This is where you brainstorm about what you want the game to be about. It could be a sports game, a first person shooter, or a story driven game.</li>
        <li>
          <b>Designing the game:</b> This step involves creating the idea of the game based on how the player will experience it. In this stage, developers also think about how code will control
        things like movement, health, items, and maps. Data structures like arrays or lists are used to store things such as the player's score or inventory.</li>
        <li>
          <b>Making the game:</b> Here the production happens and everthing gets created. Programmers write code, artists make 3D models, and sound designers create music and effects. To add on, a game engine helps by providing built in systems
        like physics, lighting, animations, and sound so developers do not have to code from scratch.</li>
        <li>
          <b>Testing the game:</b> Once most of the production is complete, the game is shown to other people for feedback.  This is where people play to find errors and glitches within the game. They make sure that the game runs smoothly and
          that the code runs properly. Issues that can be found are lagging, crashing or just feel confusing. Last but not least, checking if the game is fun and easy to understand.</li>
        <li>
          <b>Finishing the game:</b> The team fixes bugs, and improves perforamce and makes sure the game uses memory correctly so it runs smoothly on all devices.
          Developers often feel their game is never fully done. Deadlines and budgets push them to finalize the game.</li>
        <li>
          <b>Publishing the game:</b> This is when the game is realeased for people to play. Developers use platforms like Steam Direct or the Epic Games Store to publish games. These games continue to get updates
        that add new content or repair any more issues.</li>
